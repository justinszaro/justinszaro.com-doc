The Language of Programming:

* Syntax \- Vocabulary, formatting, and grammer  
* Keyword \- A languageâ€™s vocabulary.   
* Values \- the information a variable holds  
* Control Structures \- controls the flow of the program  
* Commands (functions) \- The commands we ask a program to complete. 

Doing Things With Functions:

* Functions are collections of code that do something.   
* Functions should really only perform one function. This makes understanding and reading the function much easier.  
* Functions are declared using the keyword function.  
* To call a function, call the name with its arguments in parenthesis.

Adding New Graphics:

* You can call functions by doing functionName(arguments)

Control the Flow with Conditional Statements:

* Conditional statements allow you to change how your program works  
* Conditional statements allow you to react to the conditions the program is in.
