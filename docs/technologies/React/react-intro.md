Wroteme# Introduction to React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Key Features

- **Component-Based**: React allows you to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Getting Started

To get started with React, you can use the Create React App tool, which sets up a new React project with a sensible default configuration.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
