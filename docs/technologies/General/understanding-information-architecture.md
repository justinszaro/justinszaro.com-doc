What do Information Architects do?:

* Information Architecture \- the practice of deciding how to arrange the parts of something to be understandable.   
  * A little too broad and covers too many jobs.  
  * More focused definition:  
    * Information architects use the principles of information science to help organizations present their data to users, in a way that best helps them to complete their tasks.   
  * This information is normally presented in data systems, websites, and apps. It is used in other fields and even on paper.    
* For example, information architects build data structures that are best suited to the people that are using them.   
  * Focused on:  
    * Making the information easy to find.  
    * Making the data easy to read and scan.  
    * Making a framework that accounts for future additions.  
    * Making commands that are easy to remember and use.   
  * Uses:  
    * Navigation Menus  
    * “Breadcrumbs”  
    * Layout and Hierarchy of page types  
    * Type and location of information  
    * How files are organized in a file tree.  
    * How help files are organized.   
* Information Architects have many different titles.   
  * Often work in interaction design, user research, or content creation.  
  * The role is normally fallen into.   
* Day-To-Day Work:  
  * Determine the business goals of the site.   
    * Ex: Awareness, Driving to a Purchase  
  * Metrics  
    * What is happening  
  * User Research  
    * Why it is happening  
  * Content Analysis  
    * How is the content layed out? Is it similar to the rest of the site?  
  * Work with content creators and designers to build and test alternatives.  
  * May also work with developers, researchers, or people from the business and marketing areas.   
  * Ensuring that the customer's experience is as simple and easy as possible.  
  * Strategic work:  
    * Communication Standards  
    * Designing Data Structures  
    * Must be able to have the top down and bottom up picture in their minds.   
    * Need to have a strong knowledge of the organizational structure. 

Where Does IA Fit in an Organization?:

* IA always work with multiple teams:  
  * Developers  
  * Marketing/Communications Teams  
  * Designers  
  * User Researchers  
  * Quantitative Analysts  
* Need to understand the data and how it is stored.  
* Knowledgeable about the lingo used by the different teams.  
* Understand the business and the brand goals.  
* Information layout also affects the brand:  
  * Tone of voice  
  * Terminology  
  * How formal or informal phrasing should be.  
* Communicate the changes made to the plan to the different teams.   
* Communicate changes to the website’s content and layout to the customers or client.   
* Collect user-feedback and distribute it.  
* IA’s normally take guidance from the project managers in which they work with.   
  * The central manager would be responsible for HR and career development.   
  * Becomes difficult to make all of the project managers happy. 

Tools and Terminology:

* Card Sort \- used to get an understanding of how users group content on a site.  
  * Output:  
    * Dendrograms and Cluster Analysis: Visual outputs of the card sort analysis.   
* Tree Test \- Participants are asked to place each card where they expect it to sit in the hierarchy.  
* Multiple things are created to ensure that the architecture elements work:  
  * User task flows and scenarios  
  * Story Boards based on user personas  
  * Interface mock-ups  
  * Prototypes of the final interface  
* Waypoints, signposts, and placemaking  
  * Elements of interface design that help users work out where they are and where they need to go next.   
    * Ex: Breadcrumbs, Navigation Menus, Mega menus, the footer area, the site map, and any recommendation engine or related item type content.   
* Note that information architecture is different from the navigation architecture.  
* Content providers follow the content strategie’s rules and policies to create.   
  * The rules are in the publishing system that sits underneath the site or the product. 

Software and Real-World Tools:

* Does exist outside of software:  
  * Index Cards, Sticky Notes, White Board Diagrams, and interface sketches.  
  * Does provide a different level of information due to the interactivity.  
  * Still run face-to-face sessions, usability tests, and surveys.  
* Still need spreadsheets, word processors, video conferencing, and screen sharing capabilities.   
* Web-based tools for research  
  * Types: Card Sorts and Reverse Sorts (Tree testing)  
  * Examples: Optimalworkshop, Provenbyusers, Websort, and Userzoom  
* Software Tools for Card Sorting:  
  * xSort for Mac, UXSort for Windows.   
* Need access to analytics: web metrics, search query history, and tools that visualize common and uncommon paths throughout the website.   
  * Normally in place by the company.

Recruiting Information Architects:

* Normally do not have an academic qualification related to their work (No real major in university).  
* Normally found in the graduate degree programs under different names.   
  * Interaction design, information architecture, information science, and knowledge management.  
* May be good to look for user experience and interactive design degrees.   
* IA should demonstrate structured thinking, organizational skills, and the ability to carry concepts from a strategic perspective through a detailed view. They should also have good communication skills.   
* Some skills:  
  * Quantitative and Qualitative data analysis.  
  * Experience with card sorting software.  
  * Should be able to talk about the financial impact of their role. 

Managing Information Architects:

* Goals can be set around specific work items.   
* Goals can also be made that specify the IA’s impact on a project.   
* Goals to conduct broad or open-ended research.   
* Can set specific milestones and deliverables.   
* It is important to coach and teach IA’s new skills by providing multiple opportunities.   
  * Conference attendance can be incredibly helpful.   
* Work can be tracked by measuring efficiency, bounce rate, reduction of pages people visit in error, and user satisfaction.

Where is IA Heading?:

* Making applications and websites more interactive and increasing activation.  
* Maintain the connection between the different channels of information: phone, laptop, etc.  
* How do we organize information and user experience on new types of technology?
